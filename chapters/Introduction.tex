\chapter{Introduction}
The Zero Drift Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) GUI is a versatile and user-friendly interface designed to simulate and analyze decision-making processes under various dynamic reward conditions. This MATLAB-based tool allows users to explore the effects of reward rates, boredom functions, and other key variables on decision outcomes and behavior patterns.

Version 3.0 introduces several enhancements, including improved plotting capabilities, expanded import/export functionalities, and a more intuitive layout to streamline the simulation process. Whether you are a researcher exploring computational neuroscience or a student learning about decision-making models, this GUI provides a robust platform to conduct experiments and visualize results in real time.

This documentation offers a comprehensive guide to installing, navigating, and utilizing the Zero Drift DDM GUI. From a detailed overview of the user interface to examples of typical workflows, we aim to provide everything you need to leverage this tool effectively.
