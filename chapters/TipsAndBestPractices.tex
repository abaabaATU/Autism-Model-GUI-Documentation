\section{General Tips}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always save your work frequently to avoid data loss.
    \item Use descriptive names for your files and variables to make your code easier to understand.
    \item Comment your code generously to explain complex logic or important decisions.
    \item Restart the window if you encounter unexpected behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Best Practices for Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with a small number of trials to test your setup before scaling up.
    \item Use the built-in visualization tools to monitor your simulations in real-time.
    \item Document your parameter choices and their justifications for future reference.
\end{itemize}
